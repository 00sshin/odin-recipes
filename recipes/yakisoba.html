    <h1>Yakisoba</h1>
    <img src="../images/yakisoba.jpg">
    <h2>Yakisoba (焼きそば) is one of the best known street foods in Japan, and the name literally means “grilled noodles.”
         It's thought to have originated from Chinese cuisine and became a popular fast-food meal in the black markets that popped up around Japan after the war. 
         In an era when food was in short supply, and the country was busy rebuilding, the basic ingredients needed to make yakisoba, and the possibility of preparing 
         it on large steel griddles called a teppan (鉄板), made it ideally suited for these makeshift outdoor markets.
